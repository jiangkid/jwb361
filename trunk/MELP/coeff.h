The fixed-point version of the voice codec Mixed Excitation Linear
Prediction (MELP) is based on specifications on the C-language software
simulation contained in GSM 06.06 which is protected by copyright and
is the property of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
(ETSI). This standard is available from the ETSI publication office
tel. +33 (0)4 92 94 42 58. ETSI has granted a license to United States
Department of Defense to use the C-language software simulation contained
in GSM 06.06 for the purposes of the development of a fixed-point
version of the voice codec Mixed Excitation Linear Prediction (MELP).
Requests for authorization to make other use of the GSM 06.06 or
otherwise distribute or modify them need to be addressed to the ETSI
