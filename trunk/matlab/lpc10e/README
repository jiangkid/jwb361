2.0  INSTALLATION

  a)  PLEASE READ THE COPYRIGHT NOTICE PRIOR TO INSTALLATION.  IT CAN BE FOUND
      IN THE FILE CPYRIGHT.TXT.
  b)  UUDECODE the distribution archive.  This will create the file lpc10ew.exe.
  c)  Copy lpc10ew.exe to a directory in which you wish to keep the software.
  d)  Type "lpc10ew".  Press Return.  This will unpack the LPC-10e archive.
  e)  Delete the archive file lpc10ew.exe.
  f)  Follow the instructions under 3.0 to run the software.

3.0  RUNNING LPC-10E FOR MATLAB 

LPC-10e for MATLAB uses Windows-standard .WAV files for speech input and 
speech output.  Input files should be 16-bit .WAV files, sampled at 8 kHz.  Most 
sound card software will support this file format.  Similarly, output files generated 
by the algorithm are Windows-standard 16-bit .WAV files, with an 8 kHz sample 
rate.  Follow these steps to run the software:

  a)  Run Microsoft Windows and MATLAB for Windows.
  b)  Change to the LPC-10e directory, e.g., "cd lpc10e".  Press Return.
  c)  Type "lpc10e".  Press Return.
  d)  Read and acknowledge the copyright notice.
  d)  Answer the input and output file selection dialogs with appropriate input and 
      output files.


IMPORTANT NOTE:

PLEASE READ THE COPYRIGHT NOTICE IN THE ALGORITHM DIRECTORY BEFORE
INSTALLING OR USING THE SPEECH CODING SOFTWARE.
