function synWave = synlpc(aCoeff,pitch,sr,G,fr,fs,preemp)
% USAGE: synWave = synlpc(aCoeff,pitch,sr,G,fr,fs,preemp);
%
% This function synthesizes a (speech) signal based on a LPC (linear-
% predictive coding) model of the signal. The LPC coefficients are a 
% short-time measure of the speech signal which describe the signal as the 
% output of an all-pole filter. This all-pole filter provides a good 
% description of the speech articulators; thus LPC analysis is often used in 
% speech recognition and speech coding systems. The LPC analysis is done
% using the proclpc routine. This routine can be used to verify that the 
% LPC analysis produces the correct answer, or as a synthesis stage after
% first modifying the LPC model.
%
% The results of LPC analysis are a new representation of the signal
% s(n) = G e(n) - sum from 1 to L a(i)s(n-i)
% where s(n) is the original data. a(i) and e(n) are the outputs of the LPC 
% analysis with a(i) representing the LPC model. The e(n) term represents 
% either the speech source's excitation, or the residual: the details of the 
% signal that are not captured by the LPC coefficients. The G factor is a
% gain term.
%
% LPC synthesis produces a monaural sound vector (synWave) which is 
% sampled at a sampling rate of "sr". The following parameters are mandatory
% aCoeff - The LPC analysis results, a(i). One column of L+1 numbers for each
% frame of data. The number of rows of aCoeff determines L.
% G - The LPC gain for each frame.
% pitch - A frame-by-frame estimate of the pitch of the signal, calculated
% by finding the peak in the residual's autocorrelation for each frame.
%
% The following parameters are optional and default to the indicated values.
% fr - Frame time increment, in ms. The LPC analysis is done starting every
% fr ms in time. Defaults to 20ms (50 LPC vectors a second)
% fs - Frame size in ms. The LPC analysis is done by windowing the speech
% data with a rectangular window that is fs ms long. Defaults to 30ms
% preemp - This variable is the epsilon in a digital one-zero filter which 
% serves to preemphasize the speech signal and compensate for the 6dB
% per octave rolloff in the radiation function. Defaults to .9378.
